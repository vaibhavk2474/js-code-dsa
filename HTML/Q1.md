## Q4 What is metadata in html?

The `<meta>` tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

`<meta>` tags always go inside the `<head>` element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the `<meta>` tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).

```
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
```

## Q9 What is the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS?

- Inline CSS uses the style attribute within HTML elements.

- External CSS is linked via the `<link>` tag to an external CSS file.
  Using the `<link>` element inside the `<head>` section: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`.
