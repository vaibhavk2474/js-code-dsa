## 1. What are synthetic events in React?

`SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` attribute.

Let's take an example of BookStore title search component with the ability to get all native event properties

```js
function BookStore() {
  function handleTitleChange(e) {
    console.log("The new title is:", e.target.value);
    // 'e' represents synthetic event
    const nativeEvent = e.nativeEvent;
    console.log(nativeEvent);
    e.stopPropagation();
    e.preventDefault();
  }

  return <input name="title" onChange={handleTitleChange} />;
}
```

## 2. How to create Error Boundaries in react whole flow and code?

Error boundaries in React are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. They are a robust way to handle exceptions in a React application gracefully.

### When to Use Error Boundaries

Error boundaries are typically used to catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them. They do not catch errors for:

- Event handlers
- Asynchronous code (e.g., setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
- Server-side rendering
- Errors thrown in the error boundary itself

### Creating an Error Boundary

#### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Create a Class Component for the Error Boundary**:

   - This component should implement `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` lifecycle methods.

2. **Implement the Error Handling Logic**:

   - Use `componentDidCatch` to perform side effects like logging the error.
   - Use `getDerivedStateFromError` to update the state so that the next render shows the fallback UI.

3. **Wrap Components with the Error Boundary**:
   - Use the error boundary to wrap any component tree where you want to catch errors.

#### Code Example

Here’s a complete example demonstrating how to create and use an error boundary in a React application.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

// Error Boundary Component
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error("Error caught by Error Boundary:", error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// Example Component that may throw an error
class BuggyComponent extends React.Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    throw new Error("I crashed!");
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me to throw an error</button>
    );
  }
}

// App Component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Error Boundaries Example</h1>
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <BuggyComponent />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Explanation

1. **ErrorBoundary Component**:

   - **State**: Holds a boolean `hasError` to determine if an error has been caught.
   - **`getDerivedStateFromError`**: Updates the state to render the fallback UI.
   - **`componentDidCatch`**: Logs the error details. You can also use it to report the error to an error tracking service.
   - **Render Method**: Checks if an error was caught (`hasError` is `true`), and if so, renders the fallback UI (`<h1>Something went wrong.</h1>`). Otherwise, it renders the children components.

2. **BuggyComponent**:

   - A simple component that throws an error when a button is clicked, used to demonstrate the error boundary in action.

3. **App Component**:
   - Wraps `BuggyComponent` with `ErrorBoundary`. If `BuggyComponent` throws an error, `ErrorBoundary` will catch it and display the fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app.

### Best Practices

- **Granular Error Boundaries**: Instead of wrapping your entire app with a single error boundary, consider wrapping individual components or sections. This allows unaffected parts of your UI to continue functioning.
- **Logging**: Use `componentDidCatch` to log errors to monitoring services (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) for better debugging and maintenance.
- **Fallback UI**: Provide user-friendly fallback UI that helps users understand something went wrong and possibly provides a way to recover or report the issue.

By using error boundaries, you can make your React applications more resilient and user-friendly, handling unexpected errors gracefully.

Let's break down the flow and execution of the provided React code step-by-step, explaining how each function runs and interacts during the application's lifecycle.

### Initialization and Rendering Flow

1. **ReactDOM.render**:

   ```jsx
   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
   ```

   - **Purpose**: This line initiates the rendering process of the React application by mounting the `App` component onto the DOM element with the id `root`.

2. **App Component**:
   ```jsx
   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>React Error Boundaries Example</h1>
         <ErrorBoundary>
           <BuggyComponent />
         </ErrorBoundary>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: The `App` component is a functional component that returns a tree of React elements. It includes an `h1` element and wraps the `BuggyComponent` with the `ErrorBoundary` component.

### ErrorBoundary Component Lifecycle

3. **ErrorBoundary Constructor**:

   ```jsx
   constructor(props) {
     super(props);
     this.state = { hasError: false };
   }
   ```

   - **Purpose**: The constructor initializes the component's state with `hasError` set to `false`. This state will be used to determine whether to display the fallback UI.

4. **Initial Render of ErrorBoundary**:
   ```jsx
   render() {
     if (this.state.hasError) {
       return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
     }
     return this.props.children;
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: During the initial render, `this.state.hasError` is `false`, so the component renders its children, which in this case is the `BuggyComponent`.

### BuggyComponent

5. **BuggyComponent Render**:

   ```jsx
   render() {
     return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me to throw an error</button>;
   }
   ```

   - **Purpose**: The `BuggyComponent` renders a button that, when clicked, will throw an error.

6. **Button Click in BuggyComponent**:
   ```jsx
   handleClick = () => {
     throw new Error("I crashed!");
   };
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This method is called when the button is clicked. It throws an error, simulating a crash within the component.

### Error Handling in ErrorBoundary

7. **Error Propagation**:

   - When the error is thrown in `BuggyComponent`, it propagates up to the `ErrorBoundary` component because `ErrorBoundary` is the nearest ancestor component that can catch errors.

8. **getDerivedStateFromError**:

   ```jsx
   static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
     return { hasError: true };
   }
   ```

   - **Purpose**: This static lifecycle method is called when an error is thrown in a descendant component. It updates the state to `hasError: true`, triggering a re-render.

9. **componentDidCatch**:
   ```jsx
   componentDidCatch(error, info) {
     console.error('Error caught by Error Boundary:', error, info);
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This lifecycle method is called after an error has been thrown and caught. It logs the error and additional information. This method is also where you can perform side effects like reporting the error to a monitoring service.

### Re-Render After Error

10. **Re-Render of ErrorBoundary**:
    - **Purpose**: After `getDerivedStateFromError` updates the state to `hasError: true`, the `render` method is called again.
    - **Render**:
      ```jsx
      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
      }
      ```
      - Since `this.state.hasError` is now `true`, the fallback UI (`<h1>Something went wrong.</h1>`) is rendered instead of the children components.

### Summary

1. The application starts with `ReactDOM.render`, mounting the `App` component.
2. The `App` component renders an `h1` and the `ErrorBoundary` wrapping the `BuggyComponent`.
3. The `BuggyComponent` renders a button that throws an error when clicked.
4. When the error is thrown, it is caught by the `ErrorBoundary`.
5. `ErrorBoundary` updates its state via `getDerivedStateFromError`, causing a re-render.
6. `componentDidCatch` logs the error.
7. The re-render of `ErrorBoundary` shows the fallback UI instead of the `BuggyComponent`.

By following this flow, you can see how React handles errors in components using error boundaries, ensuring that the UI can gracefully handle exceptions without crashing the entire application.

Yes, `componentDidCatch` runs before the `render` method is called again. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the sequence of events:

1. **Error Thrown**:

   - An error is thrown in the `BuggyComponent` when the button is clicked.

2. **Error Propagation**:

   - The error propagates up to the nearest error boundary, which is the `ErrorBoundary` component.

3. **getDerivedStateFromError**:

   - React calls the static method `getDerivedStateFromError` first. This method allows the error boundary to update its state in response to the error.
   - **Purpose**: This method returns a state update object (`{ hasError: true }`), which updates the component's state to indicate an error has occurred.

   ```jsx
   static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
     return { hasError: true };
   }
   ```

4. **componentDidCatch**:

   - After updating the state, React calls the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method.
   - **Purpose**: This method logs the error and any additional information. It is used to perform side effects, such as logging errors to an external service.

   ```jsx
   componentDidCatch(error, info) {
     console.error('Error caught by Error Boundary:', error, info);
   }
   ```

5. **Re-render**:

   - With the state updated to `hasError: true`, the `render` method of `ErrorBoundary` is called again.
   - **Purpose**: Based on the updated state, the `render` method determines what to display. In this case, it will display the fallback UI (`<h1>Something went wrong.</h1>`) instead of its children.

   ```jsx
   render() {
     if (this.state.hasError) {
       return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
     }
     return this.props.children;
   }
   ```

### Detailed Sequence of Events

1. **Error in Child Component**:

   - The `handleClick` method in `BuggyComponent` throws an error.

   ```jsx
   handleClick = () => {
     throw new Error("I crashed!");
   };
   ```

2. **Error Caught by Error Boundary**:

   - React detects the error and starts the error handling process.

3. **Call getDerivedStateFromError**:

   - React calls `getDerivedStateFromError` to update the state.

   ```jsx
   static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
     return { hasError: true };
   }
   ```

4. **Call componentDidCatch**:

   - React calls `componentDidCatch` to log the error.

   ```jsx
   componentDidCatch(error, info) {
     console.error('Error caught by Error Boundary:', error, info);
   }
   ```

5. **State Update Triggers Re-render**:

   - The state update from `getDerivedStateFromError` causes a re-render of the `ErrorBoundary` component.

6. **Render Method Execution**:
   - The `render` method checks the state (`this.state.hasError`) and renders the fallback UI.
   ```jsx
   render() {
     if (this.state.hasError) {
       return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
     }
     return this.props.children;
   }
   ```

### Summary

1. An error is thrown in a child component.
2. `getDerivedStateFromError` is called first to update the state.
3. `componentDidCatch` is called to perform side effects like logging the error.
4. The state update triggers a re-render.
5. The `render` method displays the fallback UI based on the updated state.

This sequence ensures that errors are handled gracefully and that the error boundary can perform any necessary side effects before updating the UI.
