### Q1. What are Pure Components?

    Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.

    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.

    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,

    ```jsx
    const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);
    ```

    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).

    ```jsx
    import { memo, useState } from "react";

    const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Name:{name}</p>
          <p>Email: {email}</p>
        </>
      );
    });
    export default function EmployeeRegForm() {
      const [name, setName] = useState("");
      const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
      return (
        <>
          <label>
            Name:{" "}
            <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <label>
            Email:{" "}
            <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <hr />
          <EmployeeProfile name={name} />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.

    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component.

The second parameter of the `memo` function in React is an optional comparison function that is used to determine whether the props have changed and thus whether the component should re-render. This function is often referred to as the `areEqual` function.

### `memo` Function Overview

The `memo` function is a higher-order component (HOC) that optimizes performance by memoizing the result. It prevents unnecessary re-renders by only re-rendering the component if its props change.

```javascript
const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, areEqual?);
```

### `areEqual` Function

The `areEqual` function is a custom comparison function you can provide to `memo` to control when the component should re-render. It takes two arguments, `prevProps` and `nextProps`, and returns a boolean value:

- **`true`**: The props are equal, and the component should not re-render.
- **`false`**: The props are not equal, and the component should re-render.

### Default Behavior

If you don't provide the `areEqual` function, `memo` uses a shallow comparison of the props by default. It only re-renders the component if one or more props have changed in a shallow comparison (i.e., for objects and arrays, it checks references rather than deep equality).

### Custom `areEqual` Function Example

Here's an example of how you might use a custom `areEqual` function to optimize re-renders based on more complex prop comparisons:

```javascript
import React, { memo } from "react";

const SomeComponent = ({ items }) => {
  console.log("Rendering SomeComponent");
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

const areEqual = (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Perform a deep comparison of items prop
  if (prevProps.items.length !== nextProps.items.length) {
    return false;
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < prevProps.items.length; i++) {
    if (prevProps.items[i] !== nextProps.items[i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
};

const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, areEqual);

export default MemoizedComponent;
```

### When to Use a Custom `areEqual` Function

1. **Performance Optimization**:

   - When you need more control over the conditions under which a component re-renders.
   - For components with complex props or expensive rendering logic.

2. **Deep Comparison**:

   - When props are objects or arrays that require deep comparison to determine equality.
   - Note that deep comparisons can be expensive and should be used judiciously.

3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Renders**:
   - When you know specific props or nested data structures are unlikely to change often.

### Example Without Custom `areEqual` Function

Here's the same component using the default shallow comparison provided by `memo`:

```javascript
import React, { memo } from "react";

const SomeComponent = ({ items }) => {
  console.log("Rendering SomeComponent");
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent);

export default MemoizedComponent;
```

In this case, `memo` will re-render `SomeComponent` if any prop reference changes, which might not always be optimal for deeply nested objects or arrays.

### Summary

- **`memo`**: A higher-order component that memoizes a component, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- **`areEqual` Function**: An optional custom comparison function to determine if props have changed. It receives `prevProps` and `nextProps` and returns a boolean.
  - **`true`**: Props are considered equal, component does not re-render.
  - **`false`**: Props are considered not equal, component re-renders.
- **Default Behavior**: Uses shallow comparison if no `areEqual` function is provided.

Using a custom `areEqual` function can help optimize performance for components with complex props or nested structures, ensuring they only re-render when necessary.
