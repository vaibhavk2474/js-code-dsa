React and ReactDOM are two different libraries within the React ecosystem, each serving a distinct purpose. Here's an overview of their differences:

### React

**React** is the core library for building user interfaces. It provides the functionality to define and manage components, state, and lifecycle methods. React focuses on the logic and structure of your UI.

- **Components**: React allows you to create reusable UI components.
- **State and Props**: React provides mechanisms to manage the state of components and pass data between components using props.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: React offers lifecycle methods to control what happens at different stages of a component's existence.

Example of using React to define a component:

```javascript
import React from "react";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### ReactDOM

**ReactDOM** is the library responsible for rendering React components to the DOM (Document Object Model). It provides methods to interact with the DOM and is used to update the UI in the browser.

- **Rendering Components**: ReactDOM provides the `render` method to render a React component to a specific DOM node.
- **Hydration**: ReactDOM offers the `hydrate` method to attach event listeners to server-rendered HTML, enabling client-side interactivity.
- **Portal Creation**: ReactDOM allows the creation of portals to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the parent component.

Example of using ReactDOM to render a component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Key Differences

- **Purpose**:

  - **React**: Focuses on defining components, managing state, and handling component lifecycle.
  - **ReactDOM**: Manages rendering of React components to the DOM and provides methods for DOM interactions.

- **Methods**:

  - **React**: Offers methods for creating and managing components (`React.createElement`, `React.Component`, `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
  - **ReactDOM**: Provides methods for rendering (`ReactDOM.render`, `ReactDOM.hydrate`) and other DOM-related utilities (`ReactDOM.createPortal`, `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`).

- **Usage**:
  - **React**: Used to define and organize the structure and logic of your UI components.
  - **ReactDOM**: Used to render those components into the DOM and handle the actual updates to the browser's UI.

In summary, React is the library for building component-based UIs, while ReactDOM is the library for rendering those UIs to the web browser's DOM.
